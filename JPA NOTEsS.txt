****Q1>what is jpa?

-->jpa stands for java persistance API.
   its a API specification of java which is used to for data persistancy.
   So to persist data between java object and relational databases,
   JPA does not perform any operation on its own, insted it uses ORM tools
   like Hibernate,Toplink,iBatis.


*****what is ORM.?

-->it is a functionality that used to develop and maintain a
 relationship between objects and relational databases by mapping
 object states into databases.

****what is JPA Entity ?

JPA entity is nothing but a application specific object which has states and behaviohur.
Following  properties an a JPA object must have.

1> Persistability       -  object is persistance if it can be stored and access from database at any time.

2> Persistent Identity  -  each entity is unique and represents as an object identity.
                           And when this identity is stored in the databases it is 
                           equivalent to primary key.

3>Transactionality	-  Entity can perform various operations such as create, delete, update.
			   Transactionality  ensures that whatever changes made in the database either 
			   be succeed or failed atomically.

4>Granuality  		-  Entities should not be primitives, primitive wrappers or built-in objects
			   with single dimensional state.


****Entity MetaDeta******
each entity have its metadeta which have information about the identity which instead in database is
inside the class or outside the class,which is represented either annotation or in XML files.
1> Annotations - this are the special tags which represent the meta deta inside the class.
2> XML	       - it keeps the track of metadeta of the entity outside the class in the xml files.


****Hoew to crate a Entity.?
